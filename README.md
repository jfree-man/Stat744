This is an example of a bad data visualization according to Wilke's definition. The graph is overly complicated with the use of shape and crossing dotted lines. Without spending time following the dotted paths and performing some arithmetic, it is not clear what the relationship between a gallon and 2/3 of a cup is. The repeated values, for example 1 gallon appearing three times is redundant information. The graph is also deceving because the size of the circles suggest a tablespoon is bigger than a third of a cup when actaully the sizes don't correspond to anything meaningful. It appears the author focused on making a pretty, mostly symmetrical image, but it is difficult to immediately draw useful information.
